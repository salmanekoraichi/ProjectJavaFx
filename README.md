## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### **MVC Design Pattern**

- **Model**:
  - Classes representing entities (Student, Professor, Module, etc.).
  - DAO (Data Access Object) for database interactions.
- **View**:
  - FXML files for defining UI.
  - Components like TableView, Forms, and Charts (for dashboard).
- **Controller**:
  - Handles user interactions and updates the model/view.

---

## üìÖ Project Phases

1. **Design**:
   - UML diagrams for classes and database.
   - Define main interactions.
2. **Database Setup**:
   - Create necessary tables and relations (SQL).
   - Insert initial data.
3. **User Interface Development**:
   - Build FXML screens for each section.
   - Link views to controllers.
4. **Integration with JDBC**:
   - Implement DAOs for CRUD operations.
   - Connect controllers to DAOs.
5. **Finalization**:
   - Test all features.
